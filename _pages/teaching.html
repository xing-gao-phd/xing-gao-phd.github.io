Informed by critical pedagogy, I envision my classroom as a transformative place where my students can develop a critical understanding of systems of oppression and elucidate pathways for dismantling health inequities. The principles that guide my teaching are student-centered learning and culturally responsive teaching. Based on my experience teaching at UC Berkeley, Touro University, and San Francisco State University, I am well-prepared to teach undergraduate and graduate topic and methodological courses that engage with place, health inequities, epidemiologic and geospatial research methods.
