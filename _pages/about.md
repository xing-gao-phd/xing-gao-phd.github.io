About me
======
I am a social epidemiologist and a UC Presidentâ€™s Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of California, San Francisco. Leveraging epidemiologic and geospatial methodologies, my research investigates the relationships between structural determinants, place, and the well-being of racialized communities. Specifically, I examine how structural racism and racial capitalism, through place-based mechanisms of marginalization, exclusion, and (dis)investment, distribute environmental hazards and health resources unevenly across neighborhoods along racial and class lines, producing health inequities over the life course and across generations. I hold a PhD in Epidemiology and an MPH in Epidemiology and Biostatistics from UC Berkeley, along with a BA in Geography and International Studies from Macalester College.
